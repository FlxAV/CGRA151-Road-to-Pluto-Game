# Road to Pluto

Road to Pluto is a game created using Processing where you, an astronaut, embark on a journey from your home planet to Pluto. The game leverages the concept of changing gravitational influence as you progress higher through space.

## Gameplay Overview

In Road to Pluto, your objective is to navigate upwards through space using asteroid platforms. Here’s how the game progresses:

1. **Starting Point:** You begin the game on your home planet. Gravity affects your jumps, allowing you to ascend using asteroid platforms that appear.

2. **Ascending Phase:** As you ascend higher, the gravitational pull from your home planet decreases. Consequently, your jumps become higher and more floaty, making it easier to reach higher platforms.

3. **Halfway Point:** Upon reaching the halfway mark, the gravitational influence of your home planet diminishes completely. Now, you start to fall upwards due to the gravitational pull of the next planet in the sequence.

4. **Descending Phase:** During the descent phase, your goal is to avoid asteroids and navigate towards the next planet’s gravitational pull.

5. **Level Completion:** Successfully navigating past all obstacles and reaching the next planet signifies completing the level.
